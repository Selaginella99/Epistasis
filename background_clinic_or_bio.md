Integrative analysis of [111 reference human epigenomes](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7539/full/nature14248.html), [Cell-of-origin chromatin organization shapes the mutational landscape of cancer](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7539/full/nature14221.html) has found that cell-of-origin chromatin features are much stronger determinants of cancer mutation profiles than chromatin features of matched cancer cell lines; and the cell type of origin of a cancer can be accurately determined based on the distribution of mutations along its genome.
